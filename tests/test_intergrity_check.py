# This test checks if the checksum calculation function runs without errors.    
# It does not check the actual checksum value, as that would require a known
# checksum for comparison. The test creates a sample file, calculates its
# checksum, and asserts that the result is a string. If any error occurs,
# the test fails and prints the error message.
# Note: In a real-world scenario, you would want to clean up the test file
# after the test is complete.
